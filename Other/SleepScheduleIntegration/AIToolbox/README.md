# AIToolbox
A toolbox of AI modules written in Swift:  Graphs/Trees, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, PCA, KMeans, Genetic Algorithms, MDP, Mixture of Gaussians, Logistic Regression

This framework uses the Accelerate library to speed up computations.
Written for Swift 3.0.  Earlier versions are Swift 2.2 compatible

SVM ported from the public domain LIBSVM repository
See https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ for more information

The Metal Neural Network uses the Metal framework for a Neural Network using the GPU.  While it works in preliminary testing, more work could be done with this class

Use the XCTest files for examples on how to use the classes

Playgrounds for Linear Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks are available.  Now available in both macOS and iOS versions.

####New iOS playgrounds - including a four-in-row game using alpha-beta search!

##  Manual

I have started a [manual](Manual/AIToolbox.md) for the framework.  It is a work-in-progress, but adds some useful explanation to pieces of the framework.  All protocols, structures, and enumerations are well defined.  Class descriptions are there, but not class variables and methods.

##Classes/Algorithms supported:

    Graphs/Trees
        Depth-first search
        Breadth-first search
        Hill-climb search
        Beam Search
        Optimal Path search

    Alpha-Beta (game tree)

    Genetic Algorithms
        mutations
        mating
        integer/double alleles

    Constraint Propogation
        i.e. 3-color map problem

    Linear Regression
        arbitrary function in model
        regularization can be used

        feed-forward or simple recurrent layers can be mixed in one network
        simple network training using GPU via Apple's Metal
        LSTM network layer implemented - needs more testing
        gradient check routines

    Support Vector Machine
        Classification

        Monte-Carlo (every-visit, and first-visit)
        SARSA

    Gaussians
        Single variable
        Multivariate - with full covariance matrix or diagonal only

    Mixture Of Gaussians
        Learn density function of a mixture of gaussians from data
        EM algorithm to converge model with data

    Validation
        Use to select model or parameters of model

        N-Fold validation

    Deep-Network
        Convolution layers
        Pooling layers
        Fully-connected NN layers
        multi-threaded
